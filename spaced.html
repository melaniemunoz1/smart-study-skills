        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p class="whatRetrieval">
            <p>This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to form
                lasting memories. It’s a pretty simple concept: space out the
                times that you study. Instead
                of spending 5 hours the night before a test studying you would spread out that five hours
                over the course of a few weeks before the test</p>
            <h3>Why is it effective?</h3>
            <p class="whyRetrieval"></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Refresh:You Naturally forget information over time. But if you
                    refresh your memory
                    periodically, before you’ve forgotten,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Well
                    -
                    Travelled Path
                    : To use our jungle path analogy, spacing increases the number of
                    times you walk down the path. It also spaces out when you do the trips. Doing a number
                    of trips over a period of
                    time helps you to really remember the path.
                </li>
                <li>Let the information set:
                    if we compare learning to building a wall, spacing allows time
                    for the mortar for a layer of bricks to set before we add the next layer of bricks.</li>
            </ul>
<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3> <p class="tipsntricks">
        <li>
          Use this in combination with other study techniques. Spacing just spreads out when you
study. Make sure to use the other skills on this site when you do study and don’t just
reread your notes.
        </li>
        <li>
           Block out realistic
amounts of time to study. Don’t schedule 2 hours if you won’t be able
to actually do that. Even scheduling 15
–
30 minute blocks that are spaced out will give
benefits
        </li>
    
<h3>How to use retrieval practice?</h3> <p class="how"> <ul>
    <li>
         If you need help setting or remembering a schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set up consistent, short study sessions over time instead of cramming the night before. 
    </li>
    <li>  One way is to use your cale
ndar to write down times to study. Whether you use paper
or digital calendar give yourself set times to practice for a test in the weeks before the
test</li>
</ul>
   
   <h3>When to use retrieval practice?</h3> <p class="when">
   <ul>
       <li>As you might guess, this technique works best when you have time to study before you
need to remember. You’ll need days at least, weeks at best
       </li>
<li>Other than that, you can use this to help you learn pretty much everything.
       </li>
