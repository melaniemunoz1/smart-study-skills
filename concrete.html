<h3>What is it?</h3><p class="whatRetrieval">
<p>To use Concrete Examples you need an actual example of the idea of concept being used. So if the concept being learned is bullying you would give an example of a time that someone was bullied. In fact the more examples the better you remember so don’t stop at one
</p>


  <h3>Why is it effective?</h3><p class="whyRetrieval"></p>
   <ul>
       <li>
           Understanding: Illustrating a concept in context in a real example can help make the concept easier to understand. </li>
       <li>
         Retrieval: when you connect a new idea to existing ideas it benefits from the ease with which you already remember those existing ideas. Once linked the new idea is now easier to remember as well because it shares paths with existing memories 
       </li>
   </ul>
   
  
 
<h3>Tips and Tricks </h3><p class="tipsntricks">
   <ul>
<li> Bring in classmates and friends. Share your concrete examples with them and have them share with you. This both helps to increase the number of examples and explaining to other people will help you remember as well.
       </li>
          
<li>Focus on the link between the idea being learned and the example. This is more important than the overall quality of the example.
       </li>
<li>Use examples from your own life. Examples you already have a connection to are the best.
       </li>
   </ul>
   
  <h3>How to use retrieval practice?</h3><p class="how">
   <ul>
       <li>
Do it: If what you’re learning is something that can be done (from writing, to web design to research methods) go out and do it. You’re creating your own concrete example and it’s one of the best ways to learn and remember.
       </li>
       <li>
Find it: Go over your class materials (presentations, reading, lecture notes etc) and look for concrete examples. If the example is incomplete or confusing, ask questions of your professor and fellow classmates.
       </li>
       <li>
Case Study: this is the next best thing to doing it, it’s studying someone else who has done it. Sometimes the professor will give a case study in class. You can also search the web for examples
       </li>
       <li>
Connect it: look for examples in your every day life that represent the materials that you’re learning. If you’re learning about graphic design you can look at design in places you go through every day like start paying more attention to the ads on busses or how stores use signs.
       </li>
   </ul>
   
  <h3>When to use retrieval practice?</h3><p class="when">
   <ul>
       <li>
          While concrete examples can be used for almost anything, they can be most effective when learning about abstract concepts or things that involve a process with a number of steps.
