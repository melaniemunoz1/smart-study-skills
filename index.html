            <div class="skill"><h3>Retrieval Practice</h3></div>
            <p class="skilllist">The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each
                other.</p>
            <div class="skill"><h3>Spaced Practice</h3></div>
            <p class="skilllist">This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to form lasting memories.</p>
            <div class="skill"><h3>Elaboration</h3></div>
            <p class="skilllist">Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your own and make it easier to recall them later.</p>
            <div class="skill"><h3>Interleaving</h3></div>
            <p class="skilllist">Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things up with Interleaving. </p>
            <div class="skill"><h3>Concrete Examples</h3></div>
            <p class="skilllist">It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.</p>
            <div class="skill"><h3>Dual Coding</h3></div>
            <p class="skilllist">Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>
